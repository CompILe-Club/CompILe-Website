# CompILe-Website
The repository for editing and testing the CompILe website. Code displayed here may not yet reflect the current state of the public website at csclub.cmwebclass.com

Currently the objective is to create a responsively designed "poster" for the club to add some polish to our image. Once that is complete, we will add more functionality to the website.

Dev is what everyone should work with. The master branch will be updated once dev is stable.
